      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is an analog synthesizer?</h3>
        <p>An analog synthesizer relies on analog signals to make sound. Analog means
        continuously variable. Early synthesizers were analog.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is a digital synthesizer?</h3>
        <p>A digital synthesizer uses digital signals to make sound. Digital signals are not continuous but rather
        binary. This means there are only two options, e.g. on/off or yes/no. Most new synthesizers are digital.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is a waveform?</h3>
        <p>A waveform is the graph a signal would make if you draw it as a function of time. The common settings on
        most synthesizers allow you to choose from sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth waveforms.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is a sine wave?</h3>
        <p>A sine wave looks just like the graph you have probably seen in math class at some point in your life.
        It is the "simplest" tone an oscillator can make. To me, a sine wave sounds like a bell. It can also be described
        as icy or cave-like, especially if some delay or reverb is used.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is a triangle wave?</h3>
        <p>A triangle wave, as the name suggests, looks like a series of triangles. Imagine a sine wave, but replace
        the peaks and valleys with sharp points. Triangle waves can be used to make sounds that many people find reminiscent
        of brass or woodwind instruments. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is a square wave?</h3>
        <p>A square wave kind of looks like square, flat teeth. The high and low points of the wave are held for
        a period of time, and the alternation between these points is abrupt, creating right angles. A square wave
        sounds more buzzy or harsh than a sine or triangle wave. I have also heard some people call square waves
        "annoying" or "cheesy." To me, they sound like something that would come out of an old computer or video game
        console.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is a sawtooth wave?</h3>
        <p>A sawtooth wave looks like a series of ramps. It resembles what would happen if you combined a square and
        a triangle wave. It sounds even buzzier and harsher than the square wave. To me, it sounds like something that
        would come out of an antiquated computer or console... when it glitches or breaks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is the envelope?</h3>
        <p>The envelope refers to the volume of a note played on a synthesizer as a function of time. The controls for the
        envelope are attack, decay, sustain, and release.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is attack?</h3>
        <p>Attack is the amount of time it takes for a tone to reach its maximum volume after the key is hit. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is decay?</h3>
        <p>Decay refers to the amount of time is takes for the volume to drop after it hits its peak.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is sustain?</h3>
        <p>Sustain is how long the note lasts while the key is being pressed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is release?</h3>
        <p>Release is how long it takes the volume to decrease back to 0 after the key has stopped being pressed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What are filters?</h3>
        <p>Filters "filter out" or remove certain frequencies from the tones produced by the oscillator(s).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is high-pass?</h3>
        <p>A high-pass filter removes all of the frequencies below a designated point, allowing only higher frequencies
        to pass through.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is low-pass?</h3>
        <p>A low-pass filter removes all of the frequencies above a designated point, allowing only the lower frequencies
        to pass through.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is band-pass?</h3>
        <p>A band-pass filter blocks both frequencies above and below designated points, allowing only a band of
        frequencies to pass through.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is notch?</h3>
        <p>A notch filter is the opposite of a band-pass filter. It blocks frequencies in the middle, allowing only
        frequencies above and below to pass through.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>What is LFO?</h3>
        <p>LFO stands for low frequency oscillator, but it is not the same as the other oscillators in a synthesizer. It
        produces sound below the range of frequencies that humans can hear. While it cannot be heard directly, it has
        an effect on the audible sounds produced by the synthesizer. It has a pulsing or sweeping effect and can be used
        to create other wobbly effects like tremolo or vibrato.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h3>Do synthesizers have to have keyboards?</h3>
        <p>No. Some of the earliest synthesizers did not have keyboards. Modern rack synthesizers do not have
        keyboards, either. You can control these synthesizers with a MIDI interface, which could be a keyboard,
        a guitar, drums, or nearly any instrument.</p>
