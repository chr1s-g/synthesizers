          <h3>Pre-1960s</h3>
          <p>Some predecessors to synthesizers were released in the early 20th century. Some examples are the
          Hammond organ and the theremin, which you may have heard in old films such as Alfred Hitchcock's horror
          classics. What is widely regarded as the first synthesizer, the RCA Mark II, is released in the early 1950s.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="decade">
          <h3>1960s</h3>
          <p>The Moog Modular, one of the most famous synthesizers of all time, hit the scene in the mid 60s. Don
          Buchla's synthesizer actually predates the Moog by a few years.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="decade">
          <h3>1970s</h3>
          <p>Smaller Moog and Arp synthesizers were released. Synthesizers began to become commonplace in several
          musical genres such as progressive rock, disco, funk, jazz, and krautrock.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="decade">
          <h3>1980s</h3>
          <p>Analog synthesizers are gradually replaced by digital ones. MIDI technology is invented.
          Roland, Yamaha, and Korg products become popular.
          New wave, industrial, Detroit techno, and hip hop feature many synthesized sounds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="decade">
          <h3>1990s</h3>
          <p>Computer software that can be controlled by MIDI interfaces is invented. Electronic music is popular, e.g.
          techno, electronica, house, jungle, and trance. A lot of this music relied heavily on samplers instead of
          synthesizers, but the Korg M1 was still popular in this era.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="decade">
          <h3>2000s</h3>
          <p>Synthesizers start to get small and more affordable. Synthesizers like the microKorg and the Alesis Micron are
          a fraction of the size of earlier synths. Korg even makes a synthesizer program for the Nintendo DS.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="decade">
          <h3>Today</h3>
          <p>Synthesizers continue to shrink. You could fit every model in the Korg Volca series on one desk.
          Some, like Teenage Engineering drum machines, can fit in a pocket. Music software is available
          on smartphones and tablets.</p>
